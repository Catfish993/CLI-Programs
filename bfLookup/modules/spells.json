        "description": "The casting of this spell causes the mortal remains of one or more deceased creatures to arise as animated skeletons or zombies. Such undead monsters persist until slain, and obey the verbal commands of the caster. A single casting of this spell may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice the caster's level of ability, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of members of player character races, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. The sort of monsters created depend on the condition of the remains. A reasonably intact corpse may only arise as a zombie, while similarly intact skeletal remains may only be animated as a skeleton. The caster chooses which remains are animated when casting the spell, in any case where there are more bodies than the caster can animate. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times their level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast."

      "description": "This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or a single 4 hit die creature, into a magical slumber. Creatures of 5 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30’ of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. Victims of this spell can always be hit if attacked. Injuring such a creature will cause it to awaken, and it may begin fighting back or defending itself on the very next round. Slapping or shaking such a creature will awaken it in 1d4 rounds, but normal noises will not. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures. When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally at the GM’s option."
